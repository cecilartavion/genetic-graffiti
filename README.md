# Genetic Graffiti

There are two parts to this program. One is that given a set of graphs, use genetic algorithms to construct possible conjectures
based on graph theoretic parameters. The second part is to construct the graphs that will be testing the conjectures. The
graphs will be made using genetric algorithms as well. This is related to the Graffiti.pc program first made by DeLaVina.

Andrew Penland was integral in building this program.
